    "\n",
    "Q: Still unsure on how to use a terminal to run my code and see any mistakes :/ What lecture should I revisit?  \n",
    "A: Command Line and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: If we were also planning to use a chatbot in our project, does it count as a unique function if we update the functions we used in class today? Also, if we use those functions, is that considered plagiarism?  \n",
    "A: It depends how much you \"update\" them as to whether they count as uniqe. For example, if you change the naming, that's not enough. You would have to actually update their functionality (what the code is doing) for them to count as unique. And, you're totally allowed to use the functions presented in class, so long as you also have unique code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is it necessary to include a test folder in my project? Could I put my test module and function module under a same directory for pytest?  \n",
    "A: Nope. You *must* have the file...but where you put that file is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do I need to include comment in every function even though the function is very simple? Or I just comment when I think it will promote understanding of my code?  \n",
    "A: A comment in every function is NOT needed; just comment where it will promote understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Are we required to use the API's for our projects?  \n",
    "A: Nope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will there be extra OH from the TA's and IA's?  \n",
    "A: TBD. Keep an eye on Campuswire. (Note they're all working on finals too and trying to figure out their schedules/availability.)\n"
