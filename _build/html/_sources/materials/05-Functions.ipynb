    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: is there an order of operations for % and //?  \n",
    "> A: They are treated equal to division\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: What is the difference between False and Error?  \n",
    "> A: False is what Python would return if the code ran. Error is what python would display if the code could not run. For example, if indentation is incorrect, you'll get an error - python can't interpret it. However, if you ran the code `10 > 20`, python knows what to do there...it will execute, it just happens to be `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Does the operator replace the assignment symbol (=)? Like should I put:  sword_charge = 90 <= OR sword_charge <= 90   \n",
    "> A: No. The comparison operator does not replace the assignment oeprator.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Will we need to know about identity and chaining operators?   \n",
    "> A: No on identity operators. Chaining operators is what we started to do by combining different operators into a single statement....so yes, but not the arbitrary examples demonstrated in the book....just that it is conceptually possible to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q:  For “and” statements when the left side is True and the right side is False [as in print(\"hi\") and False], why is the left hand side still returned? Why aren’t they both False because of the “and” operator?  \n",
    "> A: Ah...so *anytime* python encounters `print()` python is going to print the output (thus why you see hi printed). However...if you remove the `print` around \"hi\" you would get the expected `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Is everything on the textbook going to be things we need to know for exams?  \n",
    "> A: Not necessarily. The videos - those are all fair game. However, if something is in the textbook and we never do any practice problems on it or discuss it in class (i.e. identity operators), you will not be tested on it during an exam. Everything on the exam will be things you did at least one practice problem on (and typically many practice problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: how do you type out a modulus operator/ how do I get it?  \n",
    "> A: Shift + 5 on your keyboard\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Im still confused if the placement of the true matters in an or operator  \n",
    "> A: It does not. If either the left OR the right side is `True`, it will evaluate as `True`. \n"

    "\n",
    "> Q: Am I able to get help with other coding questions in ED not related to COGS18 specifically?  \n",
    "> A: You can definitely ask. We won't prioritize these...so may take a bit longer to get a response, but we'll do our best!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: how long do functions remain define or 'effective\" for in a notebook?  \n",
    "> A: Only so long as that notebook is open. Once the notebook is closed, the next time you open it you would need to re-run the code where the function is defined before being able to use it. We'll soon learn about creating modules to avoid this issue...so we can easily \"import\" functions into notebooks for use...without having to define them in the notebook where we use them. But, that's a few weeks out.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Does spacing matter, because I would write the function and it still would not not run?  \n",
    "> A: Yes! Specifically, indentation matters. Spacing between lines is allowed but not required. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: In the example from activity 1, how come we had to define name='Shannon' instead of using just 'Shannon'? I remember being able to put 6 instead of num=6 in other functions.  \n",
    "> A: This has to do with the operations being carried out inside the function. In the function I was trying to concatenate strings...so the input had to be a string. In the other functions we were carrying out mathematical operations, so they could be integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Once the function is run and the value is returned to some output variable, does that output variable keep that value until the function is used again with some other output?  \n",
    "> A: That variable will keep the value until another value is assigned to it. So, if you had `output_1 = my_function(5)` and then `output_2 = my_function(2)`...output_1 and output_2 would each have different values. If you *then* said output_1 = 'Shannon'...well, then you would store the string 'Shannon' in `output_1`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: How do you know what to name the function?  \n",
    "> A: Well, often in this class, I'll tell you what to name the function. But, on your own, the best function names are verbs (action words) that summarize what the function accomplishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: What does the type function do that the print function does not?  \n",
    "> A: `type` tells you the type of the variable; `print` displays the contents of the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: What is the difference between return and print? I am kind of confused 🫠  \n",
    "> A: `return` is a special keyword for use inside a function definition. If you want to get output from a function, use `return`. `print` is a function that when encountered, will display the contents of a variable (in or outside of a function definition).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Is there anywhere we can get simple functions to practice reading/interpreting before the oral quiz?  \n",
    "> A: The functions from the notes (i.e. `double_value`), Google Forms (i.e. `greet`, `convert_to_f`) and first assignment (the calculator questions) are a few good examples! to help practice. We'll also do an activity today in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: How can I practice reading and understanding code?  \n",
    "> A: A good way is to work through examples used in class. Then, you could use ChatGPT, provide those examples and ask it to provide similar examples (for example, functions using only variables and operators) but without any explanation as to what they do so you can think about them...and then you could ask it to explain to make sure your understanding matched."
