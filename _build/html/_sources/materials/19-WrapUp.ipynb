    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: If I have received full credit on all my previous coding labs, do I need to do CL8(since the lowest coding lab grade is dropped)? I'm very overwhelmed with finals and midterms, so I wanted to check.  \n",
    "A: Nope - you don't have to do it. Lowest will be dropped, so you can skip it...but do glance at the answer key to ensure you know/understand the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can I assume that the user will follow my instructions or do i have to account for other answers? (ie. I tell the user to type one of two options, but they type something else - should I have another return statement for that scenario?)  \n",
    "A: You can assume (for this class!) that we will follow your instructions. However, to improve/strengthen code, it's *best* (but not required) to consider other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is it better to write test functions before writing the actual code?  \n",
    "A: Most people would argue yes (and in most cases I would agree).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am still considering the final project. Therefore, I wanted to specify if the final project, since it has to include many specific features, has to be sort of like a game or can it be anything that someone else can be interactive with other than a game?   \n",
    "A: It's *very* open-ended....so it could be a game, it could be something else interactive, or it may not be interactive at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I have just barely started my project and need to overall just spend more time on it, but I am still a little confused on how you are defining original code and how much we need  \n",
    "A: If you sit down and plan out three functions/methods (that's the minimum requirement) and then write that code, you can be confident it's original. Examples of what's not original: code you copy + pasted from the internet, code from a previous assignment, code your friend wrote, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For docstrings, is it only to document parameters and return? (Do we not mention if & else conditions, for example)  \n",
    "A: Correct. It documents inputs and outputs (parameters and returns). We don't explain conditionals, etc. b/c we're not describing the inner workings of the code...just how to use the code/what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I'm still a little bit confused about what our test functions should look like. I mean like, what are we expected to include to get full credit  \n",
    "A: You are expected to include a few `assert` statements within a test function that *test the functionality of your code* ...so these `assert` statements should pass silently if your code is doing what you expected...but should NOT pass silently if your code is NOT doing what you expected."
