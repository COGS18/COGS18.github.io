    "\n",
    "> Q: are we going to use the terminals for the final ~project~ exam?  \n",
    "> A: Technically, you can do the final without using the terminal, but 1) you will need to know the provided bash commands for E2 and 2) being comfortable at the terminal will make doing your exam easier\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: can you explain how to open a terminal in prairielearn again please?  \n",
    "> A: Yes - I will demo this again, but briefly here, if you're on PL and you open a workspace: File > New > Terminal will open it\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: what is the point of an f string instead of just normal '' strings?  \n",
    "> A: Concatenating strings with `+` and using an fstring accomplish the same thing...but the spaces are more intuitive with f-strings. You can use either!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: will file paths be on the exam?  \n",
    "> A: Yup - you'll need to understand relative and absolute paths\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Will we have to create a project? (Maybe for the final we can have a choice to create a project)  \n",
    "> A: Historically, COGS 18 has had a project. Because of all the changes, I did remove it this quarter and everyone will do the exam. However, the exam will be a mini project....I'll just guide you rather than you doing a project independently. Apologies if you were excited to do a project!"
