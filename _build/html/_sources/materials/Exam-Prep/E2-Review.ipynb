    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will functions and classes only use for loops if loops are included at all? While loops aren't used for these cases?  \n",
    "A: `while` loops can be used within functions, although we will use `for` loops more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For the compare method examples why / how did it also return the number of courses printed? Like the first one I know is 5 and the second is 6 but how did it do it and do we need to have it?  \n",
    "A: This was because I had a line of code asking to print the `n_classes` *attribute* from the object. It was not from the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am also confused about the use of \"self\" and when to use \"self\".   \n",
    "A: `self` allows us to refer to the *current instance* of a given object. Tips for when to use self: 1) before the name of the attribute when defining instsance attributes; 2) as the first parameter to every method; 3) within methods anytime you want to reference an attribute (whether it's a class attribute OR an instance attribute, `self.` will be needed) \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will our lectures in the future keep building to produce even longer segments of code?   \n",
    "A: No. (I believe) Classes is the longest code we'll go through/build toward in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How much points does each participation survey worth?  \n",
    "A: Not totally sure, but if you complete every single one, it's 3.5% to your final project/final exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I'm confused about the compare method example. Why do we specifically define the 0th index for the fewest and most variables, (fewest = self.course [0]) in the function?   \n",
    "A: This was to give us something to compare to the first time through the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: The only part that I don't get is why can we set both most and fewest to the index [0]. Wouldn't it contradict each other?  \n",
    "A: Similar to the above question (read that first), we start with both being the same...but notice in the conditional, `most` and `fewest` change differently, depending upon the stated condition....so they won't end up the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: will we be using isinstance tool more in this class or not really?  \n",
    "A: Nope. Don't worry about it; just know that everything in python is an object/python is an object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: If python is an object program, what other program types are there and what would those do?   \n",
    "A: Lots explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: for the instance in class, can you create a compare method that gives you both the most and fewest value?  \n",
    "A: Yup! I encourage you to edit the code provided to return both! Let's discuss in office hours or on campuswire if you struggle to determine how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: when we used the command dir(my_date) we get a list of methods and attributes, can we use this on any object, or how can we know what methods we can use in which objects. I got confused because professor said that we use append for lists but can we use for any other type of object?  \n",
    "A: For that example, those methods/attributes can *only* be used with *date* type objects. So, you must first know the type of the object and *then* can determine what methods are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do we extract an attribute if it's a string? I am getting a TypeError: string indices must be integers.\n",
    "A: I'd have to see your specific example, but remember if you're trying to index into a string, what goes between the brackets must be an integer (`i.e. my_string[0]`) So, this error suggests you're trying to index using something other than an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: In ProfCourses, Why does the last self.n_courses+1 in add_course add 1 every time a new course is added? I'm still a little confused about this because it doesn't look like a loop.  \n",
    "A: You're right that it's NOT a loop. Each time the method is called the previous value in `n_courses` is increased by 1...so it does NOT loop, but rather would increase by one each time the method is called/executed on an object."
