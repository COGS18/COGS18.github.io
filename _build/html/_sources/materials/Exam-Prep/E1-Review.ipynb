    "**Q&A** \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For loops, do we ever move through loops backwards?  \n",
    "A: You could, but we won't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: what is `isinstance`?  \n",
    "A: This returns True if the variable specified right after the parentheses is of the type specified after hte comma. For example `isinstance(6, int)` would return True b/c 6 is an integer. `isinstance(6, str)` would return False b/c 6 is not a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How can you use for loops to add all the numbers in a range together?  \n",
    "A: See discussions on campuswire. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will the lectures always give examples that will help with the assignments? I’m stuck on Q7 on A2 and can’t seem to find an example similar.  \n",
    "A: You'll always have seen the basic concepts in lectures and coding labs needed to figure out the assignments. But, you won't always have a \"similar example.\" The idea is if you really understand the concept, you can figure out the question's answer. If you're just trying to copy+paste and \"make it work,\" you'll struggle on a handful of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am wondering why I got such a bad grade on A1, I need to re-evaluate and try to do my best. It's important I dont make the same mistakes twice.  \n",
    "A: Check your feedback on datahub, and come to office hours if still unsure. We definitely want to be sure you're clear and good to go for future assignments!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am kind of iffy on the difference between continue and break when writing the loop.  \n",
    "A: `continue` means \"skip to the next iteration of the loop\"; `break` means break out of the loop. Do not go on. Do not go to the next iteration. Just stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: To have access to my coding work in the future, I need something called Anaconda right? How do I set that up?  \n",
    "A: See part 3 of the first coding lab. You can download Anaconda to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is there a great place to find coding help for specific issues or questions? google is not the most reliable  \n",
    "A: For this class, campuswire is the best place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Does the \"continue\" apply only for the \"for\" or can it be used for other purposes? Can I apply \"continue\" to other situations other than for \"for\" and does it run completely from the top of the cell?  \n",
    "A: `continue` can be used in any loop; it runs from the top of the loop, not necessarily the top of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can we have more than one \"and\" or \"or\" operator for a if condition?  \n",
    "A: Yup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do you define odd and even numbers in a range, and them add them together?  \n",
    "A: Think about the logic about how you can use range's `start`, `stop`, and `step` for the first part. Then, consider the logic you would need in the loop to add the values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For the break function, does it matter if you put break after the for statement or after the print statement?  \n",
    "A: Yes, if you put it before the `print()` statement, it will break before printing. If you put it after, it will `print` first."
