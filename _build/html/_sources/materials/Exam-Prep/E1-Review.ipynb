    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do you search values in a dictionary?  \n",
    "A: This typically requires use of dictionary methods. We'll get there, but for now feel free to check out [this link](https://thispointer.com/python-check-if-a-value-exists-in-the-dictionary-3-ways/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: will we ever have to combine conditionals and collections?   \n",
    "A: Yup! This will mostly be done with loops (coming after E1), but it's possible to combine them now\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When the best time to use each collection and how they are typically implemented in programs.  \n",
    "A: Lists are best for storing multiple elements that you may want to update later. Tuples are best for storing multiple elements that you don't want the ability to change. Dictionaries are best for storing key-value pairs...so when you have two pieces of information that you want associated with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am curious about why tuple are immutable  \n",
    "A: Tuples are immutable b/c sometimes you don't want to be able to update a collection after defintion. Tuples ensure that you can't change part of the collection after definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How to delete parts in list?  \n",
    "A: You can use `del` (like the dictionary example). We'll also discuss methods in a few weeks, but for now see [this example](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/remove).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What are nested lists? Are they really just lists within a list?  \n",
    "A: Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Since tuples are immutable, if we were to make a mistake and wanted to change it would that mean we would have to delete it and start over?  \n",
    "A: You would have to re-define the entire tuple, yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: The daily participation survey order/titles are kind of confusing me and I think I accidentally filled out Friday’s survey with Monday’s notes but I watched both lectures! I’m not sure what to do.   \n",
    "A: So long as you don't complete the survey for a day that hasn't happened yet, you're fine. I'd say the best way is to use the day of the week (Mon, Wed, Fri) for reference when choosing a lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am having a little trouble interpreting the assignment error codes when viewing the feedback after the assignment has been graded. Perhaps you can spend some time going through this in class if possible.   \n",
    "A: This will be a focus of today's coding lab review - encouraging you to attend coding lab this week!"
