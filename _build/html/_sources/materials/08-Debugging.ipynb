    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the point of ord and chr? I didn't really understand how it's applicable to class.  \n",
    "A: Take a look at A2 (and we'll see it again on A3) - it's a way to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can numbers be characters inputted to ord?  \n",
    "A: I'm not 100% sure I understand the question, but `ord()` will only accept integer values as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: how would we approach a string with multiple characters? so that would be several unicodes?   \n",
    "A: Excellent question! Loops! We start these on Monday! And, you'll get to use them on A3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: is unicode like the official way of indexing a list (e.g., list of letters in the alphabet)? so the unicode values are official? (e.g., 'a' will always return 97)  \n",
    "A: 'a' *will* always return 97...but that is separate from indexing into a list. Think of unicode more like a dictionary, where 'a' is the key and 97 is its value - they are \"linked\" to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the purpose of unicode if we do not ever have to learn which letter corresponds to which number?  \n",
    "A: Take a look at A2 ...and eventually A3 to see how we can utilize in our code to accomplish a task!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: it seems like i get the concepts separately but when asked to utilize all the stuff we learned under one function I blank. Could we maybe do problems like these at the end of lecture to test our knowledge? Because it seems like these are the questions we are getting on assignments and exams   \n",
    "A: Yup - I will work to incorporate more of these into lecture going forward. But, I also do want you to be able to do things on homework that puts concepts together. So, I'll try to make the jump from lecture to assignments smaller, but I won't make it go away completely b/c there is a lot of learning that happens when you have to combine concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What would happen if we don't understand the question? Are we allowed to email you or the TA for clarification?  \n",
    "A: On the exam no, you'll have to do your best to interpret the question as is. If you're unsure, feel free to explain how you interpreted the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: One question I have is what does this do; my_lst[1::2]  (the :: ).  \n",
    "A: The :: indicates there is no stop value, so go from the 1 index to the end of the list (b/c there is no stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: we can submit as twice as we want as long as it is before deadline, right?  \n",
    "A: I'm assuming you mean for the exam and yes, you can submit as  many times as you want before the deadline. We'll use your last submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What has the average grade been for previous E1's?  \n",
    "A: ~85%\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How does unicode assign numbers?  \n",
    "A: These rules are actually established by a group that monitors/updates unicde rules. See more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: curious about how difficult exam 1 will be compared to practice exam  \n",
    "A: Should be similar overall. My feeling (and one TA's feelings) is that Q1-9 are a bit easier than prevoius quarters/the practice exam, but Q10 is harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will Aliases be tested on any other exams?  \n",
    "A: You'll need to understand them, yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: The main thing I am still questioning is the rules when it comes to if, elif, and else. Which is ruled first?  \n",
    "A: The if is checked, then the elif, and the else finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can you further explain Exam 1 logistics? There's a 24 hour window to submit but we can have multiple days to work on it?  \n",
    "A: There's a *greater* than 24 hour window. The syllabus says I'll give at least 24 hours. B/c I know some people are traveling back to campus this weekend and busy with other midterms/life, I decided to give way more than 24h this time. You can start whenever you want. You can work on it as much as you want. It just must be submitted by Sunday night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am struggling to understand how to properly write code to calculate the total number of components there are in a list.   \n",
    "A: Take a look at the collections notes for a function that can help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is there a comprehensive set of notes that we can refer to when struggling with remembering the proper code style?  \n",
    "A: Good idea! I'll try to pull something together and share! There is an [official guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) but it goes way beyond what we've discussed so far."
