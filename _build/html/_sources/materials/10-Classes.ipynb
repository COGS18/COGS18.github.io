    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: will we learn any methods for tuples?\n",
    "> A: No...they exist...although there are only two ([see here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp)) But, we don't use tuples a ton so I don't focus on them/\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: will quotations be included as a space?  \n",
    "> A: Nope. A space will only be included if there is a space between the quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: why did question 2 print out the final correct list option 3, but when in the example in class when we did the upper of hello example when the last print statement is there it went back to origonal.  \n",
    "> A: List methods operate in place. String methods operate not in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: In A3: when you’re working with None, why can’t you set a variable equal to None (something like \"a = None\")   \n",
    "> A: You can set a variable equal to None!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Also, why does the identity operator “is” work when you’re checking if something equals None, but “==“ doesn’t?   \n",
    "> A: `==` does work. For example, the following returns True:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " a = None\n",
    " a == None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: I'm very confused about when to know to use range(len()) and when to use append vs += and how to know the appropriate way to get the output of loops  \n",
    "> A: If you want to loop over 1 through however many things there are in a list (for example), you'd use range(len()). Append is when you want to add something to the end of a list += is for when you want to extend a string or add a number to a numeric variable. As for how to get output of loops - this is a great question for office hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: as mentioned previous that instead of using 200, we have to use key, since key=200, what if we don't not use that  \n",
    "> A: Then you'll *only* be able to use 200 within the function; no ability to use a different value\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: are the brackets necesary  \n",
    "> A: Brackets are necessary any time you want to indicate we're looking at a list\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Still confused on the try/except. How is it not just one code block running like conditionals?   \n",
    "> A: It's the way it works. For a try/except, python will *always* try the code in the try block first. If that code executes without error, it's done. If, however, an error is raised, it will execute the code in the `except` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: just to clarify attributes store information, and methods are functions?  \n",
    "> A: Yup! We'll deepen this knowledge today!  "
