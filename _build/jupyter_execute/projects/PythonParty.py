# Python Party!

It's a little bit less of a party this quarter. 

## Project-based Course

Today starts the transition to a project-based course!

Project Overview: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/overview.html    
Project Ideas: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/ProjectIdeas.html   
Project FAQ: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/faq.html  
Project Template: https://cogs18.github.io/assets/intro/projects/ProjectTemplate.zip

## Project Options

Choose ONE:
- **Complete the final project**
    - we're discussing the details today
    - submitted on Canvas by 11:59 PM on day of the final
    - opportunity to learn the most! 
    - takes a lot more time    
- **Complete the final exam** 
    - it will be a guided mini-project 
    - will be taken on datahub
    - 24h to complete

Only caveats if you take the final exam:
1. The highest grade you can get in the course is an A (not an A+)
2. There is no opportunity for extra credit

Submit one, *NOT* both (I have lots of grading at the end of the quarter!). If you do both, I will use the lower score.

## Project Overview
- must implement some new thing (_not_ grading on complexity)
- completed individually
- uses good code practices
- What you will turn in: zip file with your project
    - \>= 1 Jupyter notebook (minimally includes project description)
        - ideally: demonstrates how your project runs (likely only a few lines of code)
    - \>= 1 module _or_ script
    - a test file with \>= 3 tests



## Project Topics
- Encryption (A2)
- Chatbots (A3)
- Artificial Agents (A4)
- A Data Analysis
- Choose your own adventure (propose and develop your own project idea)

### Taboo (Off-limit) topics $^*$
- Hangman
- `turtle` drawings
- tic-tac-toe
- blackjack
- Magic 8 Ball
- Rock, Paper, Scissors

$^*$If you have a really new hangman implementation/idea or are super stoked about your great `turtle` idea or have invented a spin on traditional tic-tac-toe/blackjack/magic 8 ball/rock, paper, scissors, you'll need to pitch your idea to (via campuswire/email or in office hours) and get approval from Professor Ellis

### Process:

1. Download 1) template from website OR 2) fetch Project on datahub
2. Brainstorm an idea
3. Design what "pieces" (functions/classes/etc.) you need to execute that idea
4. Start writing code + tests
5. Submit on 1) Canvas or 2) datahub

#### Why template + Canvas?

- Certain packages do not work on datahub (game packages; audio; GUI)
- Working outside of datahub will be helpful in the future
- You are not dependent on the Internet working well

#### Project advice:
- Work steadily over time
- Work to first create a minimal viable product
    - modular design
    - multiple, independent pieces
- Rapid prototyping + testing

### Grading
| Component        | Grade Value |
|:-------------: |:-----------:|
| Concept | 5% | 
| File Structure | 5% | 
| Project Description | 10% | 
| Approach | 20% | 
| Project Code | 30% | 
| Code Style | 10% | 
| Code Documentation | 10% | 
| Code Tests | 10% | 
| Extra Credit | 4% | 
| GitHub Extra Credit | 1% | 

#### Extra Credit:
- Go beyond the requirements of the project / press yourself to learn something new (*up to* 4%)
- Put your project on GitHub (1%)


#### Clicker Question #1
Do you have an idea of what you want to do for your **project**?

- A) absolutely no idea
- B) some idea, but not sure
- C) fairly good idea
- D) I know exactly what I want to do.
- E) I'm thinking I'm going to take the final exam

We're lucky to have Jaime (one of your instructional staff members) here today to introduce and explain his COGS 18 project!
