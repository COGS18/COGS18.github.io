# # Python Party!
# 
# Parties have snacks - come on up and grab snacks! 

# ## Project-based Course
# 
# Today starts the transition to a project-based course!
# 
# - [Project Overview](https://cogs18.github.io/projects/overview.html)    
# - [Project Ideas](https://cogs18.github.io/projects/ProjectIdeas.html)   
# - [Project FAQ](https://cogs18.github.io/projects/faq.html)
# - [Project Template](https://cogs18.github.io/assets/intro/projects/ProjectTemplate.zip)

# ## Project Options
# 
# Choose ONE:
# - **Complete the final project**
#     - we're discussing the details today
#     - submitted on datahub or Canvas by 11:59 PM on day of the final
#     - opportunity to learn the most! 
#     - takes a lot more time  
#     - opportunities for extra credit (going above & beyond; GitHub)
#     - *can* ask staff for help/ask questions throughout

# - **Complete the final exam** 
#     - it will be a guided mini-project 
#     - will be taken on datahub
#     - 24h+ to complete 

# Caveats if you take the final exam:
# 1. The highest grade you can get in the course is an A (not an A+)
# 2. There is no additional opportunities for extra credit (Note: if you've been answering ClassQuestin that EC *will* apply to both exam and project)
# 3. You have to complete on your own (same rules as previous midterms, but it's completely take-home)

# Submit one, *NOT* both (I have lots of grading at the end of the quarter!). If you do both, I will use the lower score.

# ## Project Overview
# - must implement some new thing (_not_ grading on complexity)
# - completed individually
# - uses good code practices
# - What you will turn in: folder on datahub OR zip file with your project on Canvas
#     - \>= 1 Jupyter notebook (minimally includes project description)
#         - ideally: demonstrates how your project runs (likely only a few lines of code)
#     - \>= 1 module (having an additional script is optional)
#         - has *at least* three (3) unique/original functions or methods
#     - a test file with \>= 3 tests

# ## Project Topics
# - Encryption (A2)
# - Chatbots (A3)
# - Artificial Agents (A4)
# - A Data Analysis (A5)
# - Choose your own adventure (propose and develop your own project idea)

# ### Taboo (Off-limit) topics $^*$
# - Hangman
# - `turtle` drawings
# - tic-tac-toe
# - blackjack
# - Magic 8 Ball
# - Rock, Paper, Scissors
# - Snake Game
# - Connect4 Game 
# 
# $^*$If you have a really new hangman implementation/idea or are super stoked about your great `turtle` idea or have invented a spin on traditional tic-tac-toe/blackjack/magic 8 ball/rock, paper, scissors, you'll need to pitch your idea to (via campuswire/email or in office hours) and get approval from Professor Ellis

# ### Process:
# 
# 1. Download 1) template from website OR 2) fetch Project on datahub
# 2. Brainstorm an idea
# 3. Design what "pieces" (functions/classes/etc.) you need to execute that idea
# 4. Start writing code + tests
# 5. Submit on 1) datahub or 2) Canvas

# #### Why template + Canvas?
# 
# - Certain packages do not work on datahub (game packages; audio; GUI)
# - Working outside of datahub will be helpful in the future
# - You are not dependent on the Internet working well

# #### Project advice:
# - Work steadily over time
# - Work to first create a minimal viable product
#     - modular design
#     - multiple, independent pieces
# - Rapid prototyping + testing

# ### Grading
# | Component        | Grade Value |
# |:-------------: |:-----------:|
# | Concept | 5% | 
# | File Structure | 5% | 
# | Project Description | 10% | 
# | Approach | 20% | 
# | Project Code | 30% | 
# | Code Style | 10% | 
# | Code Documentation | 10% | 
# | Code Tests | 10% | 
# | Extra Credit | 4% | 
# | GitHub Extra Credit | 1% | 

# #### Extra Credit:
# - Go beyond the requirements of the project / press yourself to learn something new (*up to* 4%)
# - Put your project on GitHub (1%)
# 

# #### Class Question #1
# Do you have an idea of what you want to do for your **project**?
# 
# - A) absolutely no idea
# - B) some idea, but not sure
# - C) fairly good idea
# - D) I know exactly what I want to do.
# - E) I'm thinking I'm going to take the final exam
