# **Q&A**
# 
# Q: If I have received full credit on all my previous coding labs, do I need to do CL8(since the lowest coding lab grade is dropped)? I'm very overwhelmed with finals and midterms, so I wanted to check.  
# A: Nope - you don't have to do it. Lowest will be dropped, so you can skip it...but do glance at the answer key to ensure you know/understand the material.
# 
# Q: Can I assume that the user will follow my instructions or do i have to account for other answers? (ie. I tell the user to type one of two options, but they type something else - should I have another return statement for that scenario?)  
# A: You can assume (for this class!) that we will follow your instructions. However, to improve/strengthen code, it's *best* (but not required) to consider other possibilities.
# 
# Q: Is it better to write test functions before writing the actual code?  
# A: Most people would argue yes (and in most cases I would agree).
# 
# Q: I am still considering the final project. Therefore, I wanted to specify if the final project, since it has to include many specific features, has to be sort of like a game or can it be anything that someone else can be interactive with other than a game?   
# A: It's *very* open-ended....so it could be a game, it could be something else interactive, or it may not be interactive at all!
# 
# 
# Q: I have just barely started my project and need to overall just spend more time on it, but I am still a little confused on how you are defining original code and how much we need  
# A: If you sit down and plan out three functions/methods (that's the minimum requirement) and then write that code, you can be confident it's original. Examples of what's not original: code you copy + pasted from the internet, code from a previous assignment, code your friend wrote, etc.
# 
# Q: For docstrings, is it only to document parameters and return? (Do we not mention if & else conditions, for example)  
# A: Correct. It documents inputs and outputs (parameters and returns). We don't explain conditionals, etc. b/c we're not describing the inner workings of the code...just how to use the code/what it does.
# 
# Q: I'm still a little bit confused about what our test functions should look like. I mean like, what are we expected to include to get full credit  
# A: You are expected to include a few `assert` statements within a test function that *test the functionality of your code* ...so these `assert` statements should pass silently if your code is doing what you expected...but should NOT pass silently if your code is NOT doing what you expected.

# # Wrap Up

# ## The Goal

# To teach you a skill - of how to do things with Python.

# You've been more formally trained than *many* people out in the world programming.

# ## Where We've Been:
# 
# - Python & Jupyter
# - Variables
# - Operators
# - Conditionals
# - Functions
# - Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries
# - Loops
# - Objects & Classes
# - Command Line
# - Scientific Computing
# - Documentation, Code Style, Code Testing

# #### Clicker Question #1
# 
# After COGS 18, I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ my Python programming abilities
# 
# - A) very confident in
# - B) somewhat confident in
# - C) middle-of-the-road about
# - D) somewhat unsure about
# - E) very unsure about
# 

# #### Clicker Question #2
# 
# After COGS 18, I feel the following about my future Python programming:
# 
# - A) will use again for sure
# - B) may use again
# - C) unsure if will use again
# - D) probably won't use again
# - E) definitely won't use again
# 

# ## How to Continue with Coding

# - Write Code
# - Read Code
# - Learn and follow standard procedures
# - Do code reviews
# - Interact with the community
# - Build a code portfolio

# ## Powered by Python

# This course used:
# - Python Programming Language
# - Jupyter Notebooks
# - RISE Jupyter Slides
# - nbgrader
# - Jupyter Book
# - scipy stack & many other 3rd party modules

# ## Where do you go from here

# - if want_more_data_science:
#     - go to COGS 9
# - if you want *to do* more_data_science:
#     - ...*and* Python: take COGS 108
#     - ...*and* R: take COGS 137
#     - ...*and* machine learning: COGS 118 series
# - if interested_in_research:
#     - look for labs, tell them you can code
# - if you want_something_else:
#     - go do it!

# ## Acknowledgments

# Thank you to Tom for his original design of this course.

# Thank you to the TAs & IAs for their tireless work on this class.

# Thank you students for you time, effort and patience. 

# It's been a weird ~quarter~ two years, and for many, things are tough. Please, take care of yourself.
