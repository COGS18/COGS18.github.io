# Wrap Up

## The Goal

To teach you a skill - of how to do things with Python.

You've been more formally trained than *many* people out in the world programming.

## Where We've Been:

- Python & Jupyter
- Variables
- Operators
- Conditionals
- Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries
- Loops
- Functions
- Objects & Classes
- Namespaces
- Command Line
- Scientific Computing, & Open Source
- Documentation, Code Style, Code Testing

#### Clicker Question #1

After COGS 18, I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ my Python programming abilities

- A) very confident in
- B) somewhat confident in
- C) middle-of-the-raod about
- D) somewhat unsure about
- E) very unsure about


#### Clicker Question #2

After COGS 18, I feel the following about my future Python programming:

- A) will use again for sure
- B) may use again
- C) unsure if will use again
- D) probably won't use again
- E) definitely won't use again


## How to Continue with Coding

- Write Code
- Read Code
- Learn and follow standard procedures
- Do code reviews
- Interact with the community
- Build a code portfolio

## Powered by Python

This course used:
- Python Programming Language
- Jupyter Notebooks
- RISE Jupyter Slides
- nbgrader
- Jupyter Book
- scipy stack & many other 3rd party modules

## Where do you go from here

- if want_more_data_science:
    - go to COGS 9
- if you want_more_data_science *and* Python
    - take COGS 108
- if interested_in_research:
    - look for labs, tell them you can code
- if you want_something_else:
    - go do it!

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Tom for his original design of this course.

Thank you to the TAs & IAs for their tireless work on this class.

Thank you students for you time, effort and patience. 

It's been another weird quarter, and right now, things are tough. Please, take care of yourself.
