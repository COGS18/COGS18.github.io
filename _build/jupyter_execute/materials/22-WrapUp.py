# Wrap Up

## The Goal

To teach you a skill - of how to do things with Python.

You've been more formally trained than *many* people out in the world programming.

## Where We've Been:

- Python & Jupyter
- Variables
- Operators
- Conditionals
- Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries
- Loops
- Functions
- Objects & Classes
- Namespaces
- Command Line
- Scientific Computing, & Open Source
- Documentation, Code Style, Code Testing

#### Clicker Question #1

After COGS 18, I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ my Python programming abilities

- A) very confident in
- B) somewhat confident in
- C) middle-of-the-raod about
- D) somewhat unsure about
- E) very unsure about


#### Clicker Question #2

After COGS 18, I feel the following about my future Python programming:

- A) will use again for sure
- B) may use again
- C) unsure if will use again
- D) probably won't use again
- E) definitely won't use again


## How to Continue with Coding

- Write Code
- Read Code
- Learn and follow standard procedures
- Do code reviews
- Interact with the community
- Build a code portfolio

## Powered by Python

This course used:
- Python Programming Language
- Jupyter Notebooks
- RISE Jupyter Slides
- nbgrader
- Jupyter Book
- scipy stack & many other 3rd party modules

## Where do you go from here

- if want_more_data_science:
    - go to COGS 9
- if you want *to do* more_data_science:
    - ...*and* Python: take COGS 108
    - ...*and* R: take COGS 137
- if interested_in_research:
    - look for labs, tell them you can code
- if you want_something_else:
    - go do it!

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Tom for his original design of this course.

Thank you to the TAs & IAs for their tireless work on this class.

Thank you students for you time, effort and patience. 

It's been a weird ~quarter~ year and a half, and for many, things are tough. Please, take care of yourself.
