# Introduction to Python

**Important Note**: This course was originally designed and developed by [Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/). While lectures, assignments, exams and coding labs will be altered from the original run of the course in Fall 2018, *tons* of credit for this course is due to Tom for his awesome work getting this course off the ground.

## Expectations & Approach

- Goal: to learn practical programming in Python
- How: hands-on, community driven, skills based course, assignment & project driven
- Lectures & Lab Sections will be used for interactive activities
- Assignments, coding labs & a final project will be designed to get you coding

## Why Learn Computation?

- Computation is how things are done

- Computation is the foundation of much of the modern world

## What is Python


- Python is a programming language
    - It is a way to do computation
    - It gets the computer to do the work for you

- Python is an ecosystem
    - It is a culture of practice for computation

## What does Python look like

variable_name = "variable name."
print(variable_name)

a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b

print(c)

## Why Choose Python?

- Python is a powerful, well developed, and well supported tool

- Python is general purpose, with an immense, multi-purpose ecosystem

- Python is human focused, with a strong user & developer community 

- Python is open-source and accessible

## This is a Jupyter Notebook

Uses in COGS18:

- lecture notes
- assignments
- coding labs
- exams
