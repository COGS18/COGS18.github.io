# # Introduction to Python

# **Important Note**: This course was originally designed and developed by [Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/). While lectures, assignments, exams and coding labs will be altered from the original run of the course in Fall 2018, *tons* of credit for this course is due to Tom for his awesome work getting this course off the ground.

# ## Expectations & Approach
# 
# - Goal: to learn practical programming in Python
# - How: hands-on, community driven, skills based course, assignment & project driven
# - Lectures & Lab Sections will be used for interactive activities
# - Assignments, coding labs & a final project will be designed to get you coding

# ## Why Learn Computation?

# - Computation is how things are done

# - Computation is the foundation of much of the modern world

# ## What is Python
# 

# - Python is a programming language
#     - It is a way to do computation
#     - It gets the computer to do the work for you

# - Python is an ecosystem
#     - It is a culture of practice for computation

# ## What does Python look like

# In[1]:


variable_name = "variable name."
print(variable_name)


# In[4]:


a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b

print(c)


# ## Why Choose Python?

# - Python is a powerful, well developed, and well supported tool

# - Python is general purpose, with an immense, multi-purpose ecosystem

# - Python is human focused, with a strong user & developer community 

# - Python is open-source and accessible

# ## This is a Jupyter Notebook

# Uses in COGS18:
# 
# - lecture notes
# - assignments
# - coding labs
# - final project/exam
