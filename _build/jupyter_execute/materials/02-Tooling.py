# **Course Announcements**
# 
# - **CL1** due tonight (11:59 PM)
# - Pre-course survey "due" Friday (optional for EC; 11:59 PM)
# - **A1** will be released by class on Friday

# **Q&A**
# 
# Q: Is it possible to drop the lowest assignment grade?  
# A: No. The reason here is when I've tried this policy, many students simply didn't do one of the assignments...and then struggled on the exam where the material shows up. Instead, there are many extra credit opportunities throughout the course that allow for points lost to be gained back.
# 
# Q: What is the best way to plan to stay on track for this class? Ex: what should a weekly plan look like, in terms of what is due each week to stay on track?  
# A: This is somewhat personal/differs from student to student. If I were in the class, I would go to lecture and make notes of any part of the lecture that confused me. I would then revisit that after class to ensure understanding and go to office hours if I was unsure on my own. I would also attempt the section of the assignment corresponding to that day's topic shortly after class. This way, when assignments come due, most of it is already done. For coding lab, I would attend lab each week and do my coding lab in lab...where I can ask staff/other students questions should I have them. For exams, I'd review topics I was unsure of, do additional practice problems, and do the practice exams provided. 
# 
# Q: Are coding labs due at the end of lab or the end of the day?  
# A: End of day! All deadlines will be 11:59 PM for COGS 18.
# 
# Q: Will attending lab be required or can we complete coding labs individually without attending lab?  
# A: Attendance is not required; all labs can be completed individually without attending.
# 
# Q: Curious about the difficulty of assignments as compared to labs.  
# A: Assignments are more difficult than labs for two reasons: 1) You've already gotten practice with the material in lecture and in lab, and 2) You have longer to complete them (and they are longer than labs).
# 
# Q: Are labs also recorded?
# A: Labs are not recorded (this is b/c there are so many student questions during lab...which students typically prefer not be recorded; however, review slides presented at the beginning of lab are available to all.
# 
# Q: How long does it usually take after lecture and lab for recordings to be up?  
# A: While we're remote, I'll aim to have lectures up within an hour of lecture ending (I have to wait for the video to process prior to posting). When we're back in person, they will show up almost immediately (as it's an automated system).
# 
# Q: Just to make sure I understand this correctly, it's only the midterm that's untimed. Would we be able to take breaks during the exam? Or when we open it do we have to stay on it?  
# A: Confirming you CAN take breaks. Once open, you can walk away and come back.
# 
# Q: One thing I'm curious about is whether or not the material covered this quarter can be foundational to learning programming languages other than Python.  I'm basically asking if learning Python can make it easier to learn other programming languages.  
# A: Great question! It absolutely can. The hardest programming language to learn is your first. After that, many of the concepts carry over. The syntax/specifics differ, but for your first language you have to learn the concepts, logic, and syntax. For your next language, it's mainly syntax that has to be learned.
# 
# Q: My question is if we need to respond to all daily surveys for extra credit or can I just do some on them and have partial extra credit?   
# A: Each one you complete gets you some credit. You do NOT need to do all. (So, if you forget some days, no big deal!)
# 
# Q: What's the most widely-used programming language in the world?  
# A: Depends how it's measured, but I'd argue that it's C/C++
# 
# Q: I understand that we couldn't be sure if the coding labs would return to in-person learning after week 2 but I would just like to ask how likely accommodation would be made because I'm currently not in San Diego and it's near impossible for me to return to San Diego as an international student with nowhere to stay. Thank you!  </br>
# A: Coding labs are likely to return to in-person once campus OK's it...but remember that attendance is not required.
# 
# Q: If we are going to be going back to in person learning, will lectures held in person still be posted in the media gallery for students to either watch a missed lecture or rewatch a lecture?   
# A: Yup! 
# 
# Q: What does it mean that the assignments are graded “programmatically”? Thank you.   
# A: We'll talk more about this on Friday...but they are "autograded," meaning we use a computer to grade assignments, rather than manually grading by hand.
# 
# Q: I am currently the third on the waiting list. I am wondering am I be able to have access to the datahub while I am on the waiting list.   
# A: Yup - anyone with access to Canvas will have access to datahub. This includes those on the waitlist.
# 
# Q: are exams on canvas?  
# A: No. They'll be on datahub. You'll be *super* familiar with datahub by the time the first exam rolls around.
# 
# Q: I am just a bit confused on the coding labs, do we work on them during section or can we also work on them before?   
# A: Up to you! They're designed so if you go to coding lab, you can work on them, and submit. However, they will typically be released on Friday and due on Wednesdays, so you're allowed to work on them any time in there! 
# 
# Q: Is campuswire different from piazza?  
# A: It's different in that they are different platforms/companies. However, their purpose is the same.
# 
# Q: During the lecture, the professor said that there are 300 students. How does/do the person/people go over these surveys???  
# A: I (Prof Ellis) read them all. I think learning more about my students, understanding student questions, and knowing where students were confused/uncertain is really important...so I set aside time for reading these surveys.
# 
# Q: Are the assignments going to be one problem we have to solve or multiple problems?  
# A: Multiple.
# 
# Q: If you know if this program of data hub and jupiter notebooks is able to work on ipads? and if not if you have any suggestions?  
# A: Yup - students have completed this course on an ipad previously.
#

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine executable code, code outputs, and text into one connected file.
# </div>
# 
# <div class="alert alert-info">
# The official documentation from project Jupyter is available 
# <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="alert-link">here</a>
# and they also have some example notebooks 
# <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook" class="alert-link">here</a>

# , and more information on how 
# <a href="http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/how_jupyter_ipython_work.html" class="alert-link">notebooks work</a>.
# </div>

# ### Menu Options & Shortcuts
# 
# To get a quick tour of the Jupyter user-interface, click on the 'Help' menu, then click 'User Interface Tour'.
# 
# There are also a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. Click on the 'Help' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list. 

# ### Cells

# <div class="alert alert-success">
#     The main organizational structure of the notebook are <b>cells</b>.
# </div>

# Cells are an independent 'unit'. When you click into a cell, you can 'run' it by clicking Shift + Enter, or by pressing the play (Run) button above. 
# 
# Cells come in different types for writing different things - mainly, text or code. 

# #### Markdown Cells
# 
# Cells, can be markdown (text), like this one.

# A brief note about Markdown. It's a way to specify all formatting within the text itself. 
# 
# For example, italicized text can be specified with an _underscore_ or *single asterisks*.
# 
# Bold text requires __two underccores__ or **two asterisks**.

# #### Clicker Question #2
# 
# **What does three underscores around text accomplish?**
# 
# - A) bold
# - B) italicize
# - C) bold + italicize
# - D) normal text
# - E) I'm lost

# you can write/edit your markdown text here to determine the answer to the question

# ### Markdown Headers
# 
# ## Headers are specified with a pound sign
# 
# ### The more pound signs, the smaller the header
# 
# #### But it's still larger
# 
# than just plain text.
# 

# Lists are also possible:
#     
# - item 1
# - item 2
# - item 3
# 
# 
# 1. numbered item
# 2. item 2
# 3. item 3

# #### Clicker Question #3
# 
# **What would happen if I specified a numbered list but put the same number before each list item?**
# 
# - A) the list would have the same number before each item
# - B) markdown would still format it with sequential numbers
# - C) markdown wouldn't know it was a list
# - D) normal text with everything on a single line
# - E) I'm lost

# test it out down here to see...
# 
# list item
# list item 
# list item

# #### Code Cells
# 
# Whenever you're writing code, you'll want to be sure the cell is set to be a code cell

# In[ ]:


# Cell can also be code.
a = 1
b = 2


# In[ ]:


# Cells can also have output, that gets printed out below the cell.
c = a - b
print(c)


# In[ ]:


# If you execute a cell with just a variable name in it, it will also get printed
c


# #### Running Cells
# 
# - The numbers in the square brackets to the left of a cell show which cells have been run, and in what order.
#     - An asterisk (*) means that the cell is currently running
#     - You do not need to run cells in order! This is useful for flexibly testing and developing code. 

# ### Coding time
# 
# 
# Write code that outputs the value '6'

# In[ ]:


## YOUR CODE HERE


# #### Clicker Question #4
# 
# **Which of the following best describes you?**
# 
# - A) I completed the task.
# - B) I tried but wasn't able to complete the task.
# - C) I am not sure where to start.

# ### Accessing Documentation

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Jupyter has useful shortcuts. Add a single <code>?</code> after a function or class get a window with the documentation, or a double <code>??</code> to pull up the source code. 
# </div>

# In[ ]:


# For example, execute this cell to see the documentation for the 'abs'
get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'abs')


# ### Autocomplete

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Jupyter also has 
# <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion" class="alert-link">tab complete</a>
# capacities, which can autocomplete what you are typing, and/or be used to explore what code is available. (<i>Note</i>: Some of this functionality is limited on datahub.)
# </div>

# In[ ]:


# Move your cursor to the end of the line, press tab, and a drop menu will appear showing all possible completions
ra


# In[ ]:


# If there is only one option, tab-complete will auto-complete what you are typing
ran


# ### Installation
# 
# You only need access to datahub for this course, but for working on your projects and for downloading and opening the notebooks used in class, you may want to download anaconda onto your computer, which comes complete with conda, and Jupyter notebooks.

# <center><img src="img/anaconda.png" width="450px"></center>

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python, focused on scientific computing in Python. 
# </div>
# 
# <div class="alert alert-info">
# The anaconda website is 
# <a href="https://www.anaconda.com" class="alert-link">here</a>. 
# </div>

# ## The Anaconda Ecosystem
# 
# - Anaconda itself is a distribution - that is, a copy of the Python standard library, included a curated collection of external packages.
# - Conda is a package manager, allowing you to download, install, and manage other packages. 

# <div class="alert alert-info">
# Download anaconda from
# <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" class="alert-link">here</a>.
# </div>

# ### Notes
# 
# - If you are on Mac, you have a native installation of Python. This native installation of Python may be older, will not include the extra packages that you will need for this class, and is best left untouched. 
#     - Downloading anaconda will install a separate, independent install of Python, leaving your native install untouched. 
# - Windows does not require Python natively and so it is not typically pre-installed. 

# In[ ]:


# You can check which python you are using, and what version it is.
#  Once you have installed anaconda, you should see you are using Python in your anaconda folder
#  Make sure that the version you have is 3.6 (or at least 3.X)
#  Note: these are command-line functions that may not work on windows
get_ipython().system('which python')
get_ipython().system('python --version')


# ### Web Browser

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Jupyter notebooks display in a web browser. They are not hosted on the web, everything is happening locally. 
# </div>

# If you click on the url in the browser, you will notice it says 'localhost'. This means it is connected to something locally, on your computer. 
# 
# That local connection is to the 'kernel'. 

# ## Academic Integrity
# 
# We've had some issues in the past, so we're trying to be incredibly explicit this quarter so that we're all on the same page. (And, because this differs from some other courses.)

# <center><img src="img/academic_integrity.png" width="900px"></center>
# 
# Correction: It was for one exam; it was not constant. And it was 6/100 (which is 6% of the class!)

# *I came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about coding. Being in this position, I have made it my goal to go above and beyond in learning about programming languages that I am unfamiliar with because I personally like a challenge and I love learning new things.*
# 
# *Because coding does not come naturally to me, I plan WAY ahead of time as to when I need to sit down, uninterrupted, to really learn, make mistakes, and test out the code I write in assignments. For example, I plan DAYS ahead of time as to when I need to sit down and complete assignments. Again, because coding does not come naturally to me, I spend on average 2 hours more than the median hours/time spent listed. Not only do I spend hours completing assignments to the best of my ability, but I make sure to test out EACH AND EVERY PIECE of code I wrote in these assignments to make sure my code is “spitting out” what I am expecting, and to show you and the TAs what I was trying to do just in case I get something wrong (because showing work for some points is better than showing no work for 0 points, you know?)* 
# 
# *Each student has their method, and planning out WHEN to work and HOW LONG to work on assignments is my method; I just think it is a shame that students resort to cheating when things get tough or they are too lazy to actually learn, because again, that is unfair to me as a student who dedicates time and energy to every assignment in this class.* 
# 
# \- Former COGS 18 Student

# The most important reminder: **you must have written, understand, and be able to explain any code you turn in as your own.**

# When *can* you work with others in COGS 18?
# - Coding Labs
# - Assignments

# Working with others is *different* than copying from others. It is *never* acceptable to just ask someone for their answers or their code. 
# 
# On Coding Labs & Assignments, it *is* OK to ask one another questions *about* what you're working on. It is OK to share screens and talk through your answers.
# 
# If you find yourself copying + pasting someone else's code (from a friend or from the Internet)...you're probably making a mistake.

# When can you NOT work with others?
# - Exams
# 
# Exams are the only time in this course we ask you to work on material completely on your own. 

# Exams assess *your* understanding after you've had plenty of practice (in lecture, on coding labs, and on assignments).
# 
# It's your time to show off what you know.

# Exams are open notes and open Google. 
# 
# You *can* search the Internet for help on concepts.
# 
# You are not allowed to ask anyone specific questions from the Exam or post the questions anywhere.

# Part of your first Coding Lab will help to make this all as clear as possible!
