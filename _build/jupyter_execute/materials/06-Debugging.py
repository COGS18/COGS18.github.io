# **[AD]: EDGE Outreach**
#     
# EDGE, a free, year-long mentorship program offered to help introduce STEM-related fields to high school girls hosted by UCSDâ€™s Society of Women Engineers and Women In Computing
#  
# As a mentor, you will be a resource to your mentee(s) for the duration of one school year and be expected to attend one virtual mentor-mentee meet-up event per quarter.
# 
# Sign up to be a mentor now at https://tinyurl.com/edgement2021! The deadline for mentor sign-ups is October 16, 2021 at 11:59 pm.

# **Course Announcements**
# 
# - **CL2** due tonight (11:59 PM)
# - **A1** due Fri
# - **A2** is now available (due next Friday)
# - The waitlist:
#     - first five from each section have been informed they can now enroll
#     - nobody else from the waitlist will be enrolled
#     - waitlist "ends" Friday (meaning, those not enrolled will lose course access at that point)

# **Q&A**
# 
# Q: I am confused about the difference between equality and identity operator and when to use each.  
# A: Anytime you want to check if the value in two variables is the same, you'll use the equality operator (`==`). If you ever want to check if something is stored in the same place in memory (uncommon in this course), you'd use the identity operators.
# 
# Q: What's an example of when you would use an identity operator?  
# A: The most common usage would be to check if a variable is of a particuar type: `type(6) is int`, as this is a true statement about the identity of the integer `6`.
# 
# Q: Do you have a good resource/link that would explain the simple/complex strings a bit more when it comes to the objects?  
# A: Yup - this was in the notes, but also included [here](http://guilload.com/python-string-interning/).
# 
# Q: I was wondering why clicker question#10 at the end of the operations lecture evaluated as false.  
# A: This was b/c the right side was False (`13%3 > 1`). Note that the remainder of 13 divided by 1 is 1, which is NOT greater than 1.
# 
# Q: Does indentation have to do with loops? Will we eventually learn how to make loops?  
# A: Yes and yes! (In a few more lectures we'll get to loops)

# # Debugging
# 
# - Errors
#     - Syntax
#     - Exceptions
# - `try`/`except`

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a computer program.
# </div>

# ## Errors

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Errors are problems with code definition or execution that interrupt running Python code.
# </div>

# ### Syntax Errors
# 
# - Syntax Errors
# - Indentation Errors

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Syntax & Indentation Errors reflect code that doesn't follow Python structure, and will necessarily fail. 
# </div>

# ### Syntax Error Examples

# In[3]:


# will produce a syntax error
if True
    print('Yep.')


# Python does its best to tell you:
# - what type of error it is
# - and where it _thinks_ it occurred (`^`)

# In[9]:


# will produce a syntax error
# and specifically an indentation error
if 3 < 5:
print(value)


# Python gives you a readout about what it was expecting and where you appear to have gone wrong.

# ## Exceptions
# 
# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Exceptions are errors that occur when a code is executed.
# </div>

# For these, there's nothing wrong with the _syntax_ or _structure_ of the code, but in your specific case and how you're trying to use it, Python says 'no'.

# ### ZeroDivisionError
# 
# ZeroDivisionError occurs when you try to divide by zero. 

# In[5]:


# produces ZeroDivisionError
1 / 0


# Python specifies:
# - the Exception and specific type / error
# - points you to where the error occurred

# ### NameError
# 
# NameError occurs when you try to access a name that Python does not know.

# In[6]:


# Define a variable
variable = 12


# In[7]:


# If you typo a name, you will get a NameError
varaible


# While it's annoying, it's helpful that Python doesn't just _guess_ that you _meant_ 'variable'....because sometimes Python would guess wrong. It's better for Python to just give us the error.

# In[13]:


# You also get a name error if you try to use the wrong operator for assignment
new_variable == 1


# ### IndexError
# 
# IndexError occurs when you try to access an index that doesn't exist.

# In[14]:


my_string = 'COGS18'
my_string[6]


# In[15]:


# Relatedly, 'KeyError' occurs if you ask for a dictionary key that doesn't exist
# we'll talk about dictionaries soon
my_dictionary = {'name1' : 1, 'name2' : 2}
my_dictionary['name3']


# ### ValueError
# 
# ValueError occurs when you try to use an illegal value for something.

# In[ ]:


int('cat')


# ### TypeError

# In[ ]:


'a_string' + 12


# ## Error Recap
# 
# - Syntax Errors
#     - `SyntaxError`
#     - `IndentationError`
# - Exceptions
#     - `ZeroDivisionError` 
#     - `NameError`
#     - Index Errors
#         - `IndexError`
#         - `KeyError`
#     - `ValueError`
#     - `TypeError`
# 

# #### Clicker Question #1
# 
# What type of error will the following code produce?

# In[ ]:


if num > 0
    print("Greater than 0")


# - A) Syntax 
# - B) Name
# - C) Type
# - D) Index
# - E) Value

# #### Clicker Question #2
# 
# What type of error will the following code produce?

# In[ ]:


if num > 0:
    print("Greater than 0")


# - A) Syntax 
# - B) Name
# - C) Type
# - D) Index
# - E) Value

# ## Stack Trace
# 
# The trace (log) of what Python did as it went through your code. Gets printed out if Python runs into an error.

# In[ ]:


running_sum = 0
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for val in my_list:
    
    if val % 2 == 0:
        temp = val / (val - 4)
        #+= allows you to add the value on the right to the variable on the left 
        # and assign it to the variable on the left
        running_sum += temp 
        # equivalent to:
        # running_sum = running_sum + temp


# Sometimes these get really complex. We're here to get better at interpreting these traces.
# 
# Note that if external functions are being used, these will get longer.

# ## Try / Except
# 
# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Exceptions do not necessarily have to lead to breaking the program - they can be programmatically dealt with, using <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>. 
# </div>

# ### Try / Except Block

# In[ ]:


# Try / Except Block
try:
    # Tries to do this code
    pass # pass just says is not an operation; carry on
except:
    # If there is an error (an exception), keep going and do this instead
    pass


# ### Try / Except Example 

# In[ ]:


# Example: we want to get an input number from the user

my_num = input("Please type a number: ")

print('\nmy_num is: ', my_num)


# ### Example with Try / Except

# In[ ]:


try:
    int(input('Number'))
except:
    print("nahhh")


# ## Raising Errors
# 
# <div class="alert alert-success">
# You can also write code to raise an Exception if something unexpected happens.
# </div>

# ### Raise Exception Examples
# 
# `raise` is a keyword that tells Python you want to create your own error.

# In[ ]:


my_int = input('An integer please: ')
if not my_int.isnumeric():
    raise ValueError('I wanted a number! :(')
    
print('My integer is: ', my_int) 


# #### Clicker Question #3
# 
# Edit the code below (replacing `---` with either values or variable names) so that when executed, this cell returns `None`.

# In[ ]:


num1 = ---
num2 = ---

try:
    output = num1 / num2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    output = None
    
print(output)


# - A) I did it!
# - B) I _think_ I did it...
# - C) I'm totally lost.

# ## Helping yourself when debugging
# 
# - You aren't sure how to approach a problem: add 'in python'
# - You don't understand an error message: 
#     - Use `print()` statements
#     - Google the error message...but then you need to understand what you're reading

# ### Unsure how to approach a problem
# 
# "Write code that will check whether the value stored in `my_val` is both positive and even. If it is, store the integer `1` in the variable `output`"
# 
# ...How do I check whether a variable stores an even value?
# 
# Google: "How to check whether a variable stores an even value _in python_"

# In[ ]:





# ### Don't understand the error message
# 
# So you try to accomplish the task...below is your first attempt

# In[ ]:


# this code has errors
# we're going to debug together in class
my_val = 6

if my_val > 0 and my_val % 2 = 0:
    output == 1
