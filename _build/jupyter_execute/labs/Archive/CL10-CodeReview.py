# Optional Coding Lab : Code Review

Welcome to the final (and optional) coding lab!

In this coding lab we will be doing a code review of your project code. 

## Procedure

How to do this code review:
- Get together in groups of 2 or 3
- Make sure everyone is clear and up to date on the project description posted on the website
- Each person should briefly explain the idea of the project, and describe where they are in the project
- Review each other's code, focusing on the elements below. Take notes on any comments you have, and write them down for the other person
- Debrief each other on the comments you made

### What to Focus On

When reviewing each other's code, focus on and try to provide feedback on each of the following elements:

- Project idea
    - Can you understand what the other person is trying to do, and how they will do it?
    - Does it sound like an idea that meets the requirements of the class?
- Code
    - Do they have code that implements their idea? Does it work?
    - Are they using appropriate code constructs (operators, conditionals, loops, etc)
    - Is the code organized into functions and classes?
    - If you have any ideas about their implementation (things they could change, ways they could refactor it), take note of these. 
- Style
    - Do they follow good coding style? If not, which things in particular do they need to fix. 
        - Provide some examples!
- Documentation
    - Do they have documentation on their code? 
        - Where is it missing documentation?
        - If they have documentation, is it properly formatted?
    - If you find any code segments confusing, recommend using some in line comments
- Recommendations
    - Do you have any recommendations for the project?
        - Is there anything you think they could do a bit different?
        - Anything you think they could add?

### Giving Good Feedback

- There are always things that can be improved.
    - 'Looks good' is not particularly useful feedback. What can they improve?
    - Focus on actionable comments. What can they do to make this code better?
- Keep in mind that the other person has thought about this idea more than you
    - There is probably a reason why they did things the way they did.
    - If they aren't doing something that you think is obvious, ask why before jumping into assuming they've missed something. 
- Acknowledge where the person is in the process
    - You don't have to list out things they already know they still have to do
- Make sure, as you do your code reviews, that you are kind and respectful
    - The goal here is to help each work through the project, and to get feedback from another person, highlighting anything that the person might have missed
    - Productive code reviews should be done with the with a sincere intention of helping the other person

### Receiving Feedback

- Remember that the other person should be working in good faith to help you out
    - Don't get defensive - hear them out. Listen to what they are saying. 
    - Pause your first reaction. Take a second to acknowledge where they are coming from before responding
- If anything is unclear about the feedback, ask questions
    - If you are not sure what they mean about a particular idea, ask for an example
- Thank the other person for taking the time and effort to provide feedback on your project

### Notes
- If you have time, you can do more than one code review, with another person.
- If you want to, you are recommended to organize with other students to do additional code reviews, outside of the coding lab.
