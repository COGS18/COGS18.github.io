# Code Projects

### Modular Design

<div class="alert alert-success">
Modular design, like modular programming, is the approach of designing and building things as independent modules. 
</div>

### Minimal Viable Product

<div class="alert alert-success">
A 'minimal viable product' is a product that contains the minimum amount of implemented features to use the code product - no more, no less.</div>

### Rapid Prototyping

<div class="alert alert-success">
Rapid prototyping is an approach for developing things in which you work on minimal prototypes and iterate on them quickly. 
</div>

## Project Organization

### Organizing Code

- Notebooks: good for interactive development
- Modules: for storing mature Python code, that you can import
- Scripts: a Python file for executing a particular task

### Project Workflow

Typical project workflow:

- Develop code interactively in a Jupyter notebook
- As functions & classes become mature, move them to Python files that you then import
    - As you do so, go back through them to check for code style, add documentation, and write some code tests
- At the end of a project, write a standalone script that runs the project

## Code Review

<div class="alert alert-success">
Code reviews is a process for systematically reviewing someone else's code. 
</div>

## Refactoring

<div class="alert alert-success">
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code, without changing it's external behaviour. 
</div>
