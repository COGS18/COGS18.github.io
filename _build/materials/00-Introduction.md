## Why Learn Computation?

- Computation is how things are done

- Computation is the foundation of much of the modern world

## What is Python


- Python is a programming language
    - It is a way to do computation

- Python is an ecosystem
    - It is a culture of practice for computation

## What does Python look like



{:.input_area}
```python
variable_name = "Variable value."
print(variable_name)
```


{:.output_stream}
```
Variable value.

```



{:.input_area}
```python
a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b

print(c)
```


{:.output_stream}
```
3

```

## Why Choose Python?

- Python is a powerful, well developed, and well supported tool

- Python is general purpose, with an immense, multi-purpose ecosystem

- Python is human focused, with a strong user & developer community 

- Python is open-source and accessible

- Python is (er...can be?) fun

## This is a Jupyter Notebook

Uses in COGS18:

- lecture notes
- assignments
- coding labs
