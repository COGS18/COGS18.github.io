# Introduction to Python

Shannon Ellis

**Important Note**: This course was originally designed and developed by [Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/). While lectures, assignments, exams and coding labs will be altered from the original run of the course in Fall 2018, *tons* of credit for this course is due to Tom for his awesome work getting this course off the ground.


The PDF slides from the start of the first class are available here: https://cogs18.github.io/assets/intro/01_welcome_Sp20.pdf

# Expectations & Approach

- Goal: to learn practical programming in Python
- How: hands-on, community driven, skills based course, assignment & project driven
- Lectures & Lab Sections will be used for interactive activities
- Assignments, coding labs & a final project will be designed to get you coding

## Why Learn Computation?

- Computation is how things are done

- Computation is the foundation of much of the modern world

## What is Python


- Python is a programming language
    - It is a way to do computation
    - It gets the computer to do the work for you

- Python is an ecosystem
    - It is a culture of practice for computation

## What does Python look like



{:.input_area}
```python
variable_name = "variable name."
print(variable_name)
```


{:.output_stream}
```
variable name.

```



{:.input_area}
```python
a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b

print(c)
```


{:.output_stream}
```
3

```

## Why Choose Python?

- Python is a powerful, well developed, and well supported tool

- Python is general purpose, with an immense, multi-purpose ecosystem

- Python is human focused, with a strong user & developer community 

- Python is open-source and accessible

## This is a Jupyter Notebook

Uses in COGS18:

- lecture notes
- assignments
- coding labs
