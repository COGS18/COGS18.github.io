# Python Party!

### Parties have to have snacks!

### Come on up and grab a snack for yourself!

## Course Announcements

- A4 due tonight (11:59 PM)

## Project-based Course

Today starts the transition to a project-based course!

Project details are on the website: https://cogs18.github.io/assets/intro/projects/overview.pdf  
Project ideas are too: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/ProjectIdeas/

## Project Overview
- must implement some new thing (_not_ grading on complexity)
- completed individually
- uses good code practices
- What you will turn in: zip file with your project
    - \>= 1 Jupyter notebook (minimally includes project description)
    - \>= 1 module _or_ script
        - includes a test file



### Project advice:
- Work steadily over time
- Work to first create a minimal viable product
    - modular design
    - multiple, independent pieces
- Rapid prototyping + testing

### Coding Labs

Will largely be project-focused going forward

- Week 7 : Project Brainstorm
- Week 8 : Command Line + modules
- Week 9 : Project Overview
- Week 10 : Code Review (_optional_)
