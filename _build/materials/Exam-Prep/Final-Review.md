### Notes

- CL5 & A5: really great practice for the exam
- For this exam, read through the whole exam before you get started
- There will be a notebook (start there!), but there will also be two `.py` files. You'll be instructed to use/edit/update these from the instructions in the notebook
- At the end of the exam, you'll have completed a "mini project"

Let's review Coding Lab 5...

## Questions?

## Practice Exam

To the practice exam on datahub...

# Wrap Up

## The Goal

To teach you a skill - of how to do things with Python.

You've been more formally trained than *many* people out in the world programming.

## Where We've Been:

- Python & Jupyter
- Variables
- Operators
- Conditionals
- Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries
- Loops
- Functions
- Objects & Classes
- Namespaces
- Command Line
- Scientific Computing, & Open Source
- Documentation, Code Style, Code Testing

## How to Continue with Coding

- Write Code
- Read Code
- Learn and follow standard procedures
- Do code reviews
- Interact with the community
- Build a code portfolio

## Powered by Python

This course used:
- Python Programming Language
- Jupyter Notebooks
- RISE Jupyter Slides
- nbgrader
- Jupyter Book
- scipy stack & many other 3rd party modules

## Where do you go from here

- if want_more_data_science:
    - go to COGS 9
- if you want_more_data_science *and* Python
    - take COGS 108
- if interested_in_research:
    - look for labs, tell them you can code
- if you want_something_else:
    - go do it!

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Tom for his original design of this course.

Thank you to the TAs & IAs for all of their help this Summer.

Thank you students for you time, effort and patience. 

Have a nice rest of your Summer all!
