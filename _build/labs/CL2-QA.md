## CL2 - Q&A
---

Q : I’m having some issues with this : Set the variable `comp_1` to the result of whether 17 squared is not the same as 867 divided by 3. I’m not exactly sure which operation to use to compare this. Mostly the “is not the same as”, could you use `!=`  
A : Yes

Q : What is to be done with “Find at least one integer that raises an assertion error”  
A : You need to find an integer which generates an assertion error. That means that you assign a variable a certain value and when you assert that variable you generate an assertion error.

Q : what does the `raise NotImplementError()` do? Should I leave it in?  
A : This is a placeholder that will throw an error every time it's in a cell. Once you have implemented the code you can must that line to avoid getting an error.

Q : How do I add a comment to the markdown?  
A : you can create a markdown cell and then add your text in the same

Q : For the second part of the operator questions, should `True` be returned for all the questions?  
A : Yes

Q : What do we do when it asks us to `assert None`? Do we just type in `assert None`?  
A : Yes

Q : What are we supposed to do for part 3: asserts? you said experiment but like the first part of it there’s a part where we write code  
A :  you need to declare a Boolean in that section

Q: Are we allowed to add new cells to put our answer in?   
A: you should put your code in cells where it says #YOUR CODE HERE.

Q: what is the difference between `=` and `==`?  
A: the single equal sign is used for assignment, assigning a value to a variable. The double equal sign is used for boolean expressions, checking if the left and right side have equal values.
 
Q: Can you put multiple asserts in the same cell?  
A: Yes

Q: How do we add spaces to a String?  
A: Use String concatenation by adding strings together. Example: `‘Hello’ + ‘ ‘ + ‘World!’` becomes `‘Hello World!’`
