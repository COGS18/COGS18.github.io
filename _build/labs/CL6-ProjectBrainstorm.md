# Coding Lab 6: Project Brainstorm

Welcome to the sixth coding lab!

First, make sure you have read through the Project Description outline that is posted on the website.

Now, try and spend some time to explore what ideas you would like to work on.

Talk to some other students to share ideas, and ask questions of the TAs & IAs.

Try to figure out a first idea of what you would like to work on.
