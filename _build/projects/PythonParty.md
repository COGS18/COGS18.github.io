## Project-based Course

Today starts the transition to a project-based course!

Project Overview: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/overview/  
Project Ideas: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/ProjectIdeas/  
Project FAQ: https://cogs18.github.io/projects/faq/


## Project Overview
- must implement some new thing (_not_ grading on complexity)
- completed individually
- uses good code practices
- What you will turn in: zip file with your project
    - \>= 1 Jupyter notebook (minimally includes project description)
        - ideally: demonstrates how your project runs (likely only a few lines of code)
    - \>= 1 module _or_ script
    - a test file with \>= 2 tests



## Project Topics
- Encryption (A2)
- Chatbots (A3)
- Artificial Agents (A4)
- A Data Analysis
- Choose your own adventure (propose and develop your own project idea)

### Taboo (Off-limit) topics $^*$
- Hangman
- `turtle` drawings

$^*$If you have a really new hangman implementation/idea or are super stoked about your great `turtle` idea, you'll need to pitch your idea to (via email or in office hours) and get approval from Professor Ellis

### Project advice:
- Work steadily over time
- Work to first create a minimal viable product
    - modular design
    - multiple, independent pieces
- Rapid prototyping + testing

### Coding Labs

Will largely be project-focused going forward

- Week 8 : Project Brainstorming
- Week 9 : Project Completion
- Week 10 : Code Review (_optional_)
