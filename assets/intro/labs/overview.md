# Coding Labs

Coding Labs are a hands-on section of the course in which you must attend a lab section and work through a provided lab exercise during the 50 minute lab meeting time.

#### Lab Attendance

To get credit for the Coding Labs, you must complete at least 6 out of 8 of the Coding Labs during lab section time. You must be able to attend a lab section. In general, while you have the option to attend any discussion section, please do your best to attend the lab section you are enrolled for. If too many people end up regularly attending one discussion section each week, we'll revise this policy. If you have a specific conflict with your lab time on a particular week, you may
attend another lab section time to make up the Coding Lab.

#### Work Together

Coding Labs are meant to be collaborative. For all labs, you should aim to talk to the people around you, and work with at least 1 other person on the lab. Some labs will have specific instructions and requirements for working together.

#### Explore
Coding Labs are also meant to be exploratory. There are broad questions in the notebook that you should explore, and try to answer - but you are also very much encouraged to explore related topics as questions about how things work come to mind. Consider the instructions as guidelines to start from. 

#### Credit

To get credit for a coding lab, you must attend a lab section and work on the coding lab in the lab section. Near the end of the coding lab, a course staff member will come around and check off your name that you have participated in the Coding Lab. You are not required to have necessarily finished the whole Coding Lab - as long as you have spent time working on it and engaging in the material, you will be marked to have participated in the coding lab. Note that if you are late and miss a large section of the coding lab, missing more than ~20 minutes of the lab, you will not be considered to have participated in the lab.

If you feel like you have finished the Coding Lab early, you still need to stay in Coding Lab until a staff member has checked off your participation. You can either spend any extra time doing some more explorations on the open ended questions, or go and help out other students around you.

Note that lab sections are not time to work on assignments. If you have a particular question about an assignment, you can ask a course staff member during section time, but that otherwise you should spend time on the Coding Lab.
