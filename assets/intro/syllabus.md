# COGS 18: Introduction to Python 

**Spring 2021 (B00)**  
**MWF 8-8:50 (remote)**  

DRAFT: This syllabus will be finalized during week 1 of the quarter.

---

## COURSE OVERVIEW

Welcome to COGS 18! The core goal of this class is to teach you introductory, hands-on skills for computer programming, specifically using the Python programming language. We aim to do so in a way that fits well within the cognitive science department, using particularly-relevant use cases. Our approach is to focus on programming as a tool and to get you started with the necessary background and basic skills required to get you reading and writing code. We aim to provide you with a strong foundation so that you can continue programming after you leave this class, applying the skills you learn here to your domain or topic of interest.

### A Note About Remote Learning

For some of you, remote learning is new. For others, you've got a bit of practice. For all of us, there is a lot going on in the world. While students have always been under a fair amount of pressure and stress, the struggles students may encounter this quarter (for a whole bunch of different reasons) may go beyond what is typical. I want you all to know that I fully understand this and am here to help you succeed. 

While regular deadlines have been established to help keep you all on track, I want you to know up front that I am a very reasonable person. While I ask that you all do your best to meet deadlines that have been set, know that if you're struggling, I absolutely want you to reach out to let me know, to ask for an extension, or to discuss some other accommodation.

Please take care of yourselves and one another, and I'll work as hard as needed to ensure success for all students this quarter.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

- Program at an introductory level in the Python programming language
- Read basic Python programs, recognizing the structures they use and be able to explain how they work
- Solve basic problems using programmatic solutions
- Write and debug small Python programs
- Execute Python programs on your local computer, using notebooks and the command line
- Describe and implement best practices in Python, keeping in mind that programming is done by and for humans

To achieve these objectives, information will be presented during lecture. You will have the opportunity to program in lecture, during coding lab, and throughout all assignments. Examples throughout this course will be related to cognitive science, focusing on data analysis, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and programmatic thinking.

## GRADING & ATTENDANCE

**Grading**: 

|                 | \% of Grade   | Requirement  |
| --------------: |:-------------:|:------------------------------|
| Assignments 	  | 40\%       	  | Complete 5 Assignments        |
| Midterms        | 25\%          | Complete 2 online Exams       |
| Coding Lab      | 16\%		      | Participate in 8 Coding Labs  |
| Final Project	  | 19\%          | Complete Final Project OR Final Exam |

**Exam timing**: For the midterms, there will be a flexible window during which you can complete the exams.

### Grades

All grades will be released on Canvas. It is your responsibility to check that your assignment was submitted, that your grade is accurate, and to get in touch if any are missing and/or you think there is a problem.

To calculate final grades, I use the [standard grading scale](https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/) and do not round grades up.
 
### Assignment Regrades

We will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you've earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it's important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post *privately* on Campuswire to "Instructors" using the "regrades" tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.

Note that points will *not* be rewarded if you fail to follow instructions. For example, if the instructions say to name the variable `orange` and you name it `ornage` (misspelled), you will not be rewarded credit upon regrade. This is because (1) following instructions and being detail-oriented is important and (2) there are hundreds of students taking the course this quarter. It would be an unfair burden to place on TAs if we didn't have this policy.


### Attendance

Attendance will be neither required nor incentivized for any part of the course this quarter. This policy is in place because we do not want to disadvantage students working in different time zones. While lectures and coding labs will take place during their scheduled times, there *will* be options for students to complete all work asynchronously.

### Lecture

Lectures will take place at their scheduled time for those who are able to attend. As typically occurs in COGS 18, students will be encouraged to follow along with the notes, will be given time to complete small coding challenges during lecture on their own, and will have the opportunity to see their classmates thoughts (via zoom polls, rather than with iclickers) during lecture.

However, every lecture will also be recorded and shared so that students who are not able to or choose not to watch during the scheduled class time are still able to receive and digest all class materials. If a lecture recording ever fails during class, Prof Ellis will re-record a lecture, ensuring all students have access to the material. Lecture recordings will be available on Canvas in the Media Gallery by 2PM after the live lecture is delivered.

There will also be a daily lecture survey (link on Canvas) to provide feedback about each lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project/exam. Completion of all surveys can provide up to 3.5% extra credit on your final projec/exam (*not* your final course grade).

### Coding Labs (16\%)

Lab times will be used to get hands-on practice with the course material in a smaller group setting. As such, you will be provided with specific tutorials or activities each week that are focused on preparing you for the assignments. Across the quarter there will be 8 different coding labs (2\% each). 

Coding labs will be submitted in the same place as assignments using the same process; however, they will *not* be autograded for *correctness*. They will instead be spot-checked by instructional staff for concerted student *effort*. There are no late submissions for coding labs.

While you're encouraged to work on these during your assigned lab times in the zoom session with instructional staff present (particularly if you're struggling with the material!), you are not required to do so. To receive credit for a coding lab, you have to submit your attempted coding lab for that week by Wednesday at 11:59 PM each week. There will be no coding labs due on campus holidays.

Note: You should be signed up for the Coding Lab for which you can attend. However, if you are unable to attend the Coding Lab for which you are signed up, you are free to attend the other Coding Lab in a given week. Note that this policy could change if too many people are attending one Coding Lab each week. We intentionally have Coding Lab capped at 50 so that students can get help from their TAs and IAs during this time.

### Assignments (40\%)

There will be five assignments, each worth 8\% of your final grade. Assignments will be hands-on coding assignments. Assignments are to be completed individually and submitted on datahub. You will typically have about 1 week after release to complete each assignment. Assignments will be due on Mondays by 11:59 PM. 

Late assignments will be accepted at 75\% credit for 72 hours (3 days) after the assignment's due date. Once the late deadline passes, assignments will be graded, feedback will be made available on datahub, and assignments will no longer be able to be submitted for credit.

You *are* permitted to work with classmates on assignments; however, you are personally responsible for understanding everything you turn in. While you may ask one another about assignments, you may not copy directly from a classmate. And, you may not post full assignments nor any part of any assignment on the Internet (i.e. Chegg or related site). Evidence of cheating on an assignment will result (at minimum) in loss of a full letter grade in the course.

### Midterms (25\%)

There will be a flexible 24h time window during which students will be able to complete each midterm exam. There will be no late submissions for midterm exams (however, if something comes up in your life specifically, definitely email Professor Ellis). 

There will be two midterms (see Course Schedule). Each midterm is worth 12.5\% of your grade. The exams will include varied question types and will be taken online.

During exams this quarter, you *will* be allowed to consult outside resources (your notes, Google, etc.); however, you ***must complete the exam on your own without any type of communication with other humans***. For example, while you're allowed to look something up on Google or look over your class notes, you may not ask anyone about a question or their thoughts regarding your answer. You may not text/communicate on any messaging apps about the exam with anyone. You may not take the exam while looking at someone else's exam/computer. On exam days, there will be no office hours.

As former students know, I take academic integrity seriously, but I also trust most students to do the right thing. I would rather spend more time teaching and less time ensuring that there is no way for students to cheat because let's be honest...there's *always* a way to cheat. I trust and am confident that the vast majority of students care about their education enough to take this seriously and am unwilling to spend all my energy focused on those students who do not. That said, students should anticipate that if they are caught cheating on an exam, they will fail the class. ::steps off soapbox::


### Final Project OR Exam (19\%)

Students will choose whether they complete the final project OR the final exam, worth 19\% of your final grade Students get to choose which option is best for them but may only submit one *and* there are two limitations of choosing the final exam 1) There is no opportunity for extra credit on the final exam and 2) the highest grade you can get if you choose the exam is an A. (To earn an A+, you must do the final project.)

**Final Project**
You will learn more from the final project than you will from the final exam, but the project is more time-consuming and involved. We will discuss the details elsewhere; however, briefly, you will either (1) expand upon one of the class assignments adding original elements or (2) write original code for a project topic of your choosing. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that you can write good, well-documented code that solves the problem you've set out to solve.

**Final Exam**
The final exam will be taken on the same platform and with the same time constraints as the midterm. Further details will be discussed in class.

## OTHER GOOD STUFF

### Campuswire Rules

Campuswire is an incredible resource for technical classes. It gives you a place to post questions and an opportunity to answer others' questions. We do our very best as an instructional staff to answer each and every question in a timely manner. We also want to make sure this platform is being used to learn and not thwarting anyone's education. To make all of this possible, there are a few rules for this course's campuswire:

1. Before posting your question, look at questions that have already been posted to avoid duplicates.
2. If posting about an assignment, note title should have assignment number, question number, and 1-2 words about the question. (i.e. A1 Q1 Variable Naming)
3. Never post an answer to or code for an assignment on a public post. Pseudocode is encouraged for public posts. If you must include code for an assignment, make this post private (to "Instructors & TAs" only) on Campuswire. 
4. Your post must include not only your question/where you're stuck, but also what you've already done to try to solve it so far and what resources (class notes, online URLs, etc.) you used to try to answer the question up to this point.

### Class Conduct

In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the [UC San Diego principles of community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).
 
This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with Prof. Ellis, your TAs, or IAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that's OK! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.  

### Academic Integrity

Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. For assignments, it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you've submitted and to make sure the correct file has been submitted and that the submission is uncorrupted. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing your assignment (sellis@ucsd.edu), or else it will be graded as late.

### Disability Access

Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. Please make arrangements to contact Professor Ellis privately to arrange accommodations.

Contacting the OSD can help you further:  
858.534.4382 (phone)  
osd@ucsd.edu (email)  
http://disabilities.ucsd.edu  

### How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback 

It's great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we're able to get to everyone's questions. 

That said, to ensure that we're respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they're only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9AM-5PM). Professor Ellis is also going to do her best to stick to these working hours and only go on Campuswire MWF each week. However, I know that's not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.

If you have:

- **questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so post these to Campuswire! 
- **a technical assignment question** - come to office hours (or post to Campuswire). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished 'in person' where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Campuswire. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.
- **been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren't even really sure where to start** - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn't working. That's OK - we've all been there! IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren't exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on Campuswire). If you don't have a specific question, include the information you have (what you're stuck on, the code you've been trying that hasn't been happening, and/or the error messages you've been getting).
- **questions about course logistics** - first, check the syllabus. If you can't find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Campuswire.
- **questions about a grade** - Post on Campuswire with "regrades" tag in a private post to "Instructors & TAs".
- **something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth** - feel free to email Professor Ellis (sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS18 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.
- **some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously** - If you've been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn't but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the [anonymous Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/2nXnDNbgYuS1OsGF2)*

*This form can be taken down at any time if it's not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen. 

### What should you call me?

Most students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that's great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I'm also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis. I would prefer you *not* address me as Ms./Miss/Mrs. Ellis. 

### What I should call you

I should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (either in the chat, out loud on zoom, or via email/Campuswire after the fact...however you're most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.
