    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is it possible to drop the lowest assignment grade?  \n",
    "A: No. The reason here is when I've tried this policy, many students simply didn't do one of the assignments...and then struggled on the exam where the material shows up. Instead, there are many extra credit opportunities throughout the course that allow for points lost to be gained back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the best way to plan to stay on track for this class? Ex: what should a weekly plan look like, in terms of what is due each week to stay on track?  \n",
    "A: This is somewhat personal/differs from student to student. If I were in the class, I would go to lecture and make notes of any part of the lecture that confused me. I would then revisit that after class to ensure understanding and go to office hours if I was unsure on my own. I would also attempt the section of the assignment corresponding to that day's topic shortly after class. This way, when assignments come due, most of it is already done. For coding lab, I would attend lab each week and do my coding lab in lab...where I can ask staff/other students questions should I have them. For exams, I'd review topics I was unsure of, do additional practice problems, and do the practice exams provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Are coding labs due at the end of lab or the end of the day?  \n",
    "A: End of day! All deadlines will be 11:59 PM for COGS 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will attending lab be required or can we complete coding labs individually without attending lab?  \n",
    "A: Attendance is not required; all labs can be completed individually without attending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Curious about the difficulty of assignments as compared to labs.  \n",
    "A: Assignments are more difficult than labs for two reasons: 1) You've already gotten practice with the material in lecture and in lab, and 2) You have longer to complete them (and they are longer than labs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Are labs also recorded?\n",
    "A: Labs are not recorded (this is b/c there are so many student questions during lab...which students typically prefer not be recorded; however, review slides presented at the beginning of lab are available to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How long does it usually take after lecture and lab for recordings to be up?  \n",
    "A: While we're remote, I'll aim to have lectures up within an hour of lecture ending (I have to wait for the video to process prior to posting). When we're back in person, they will show up almost immediately (as it's an automated system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Just to make sure I understand this correctly, it's only the midterm that's untimed. Would we be able to take breaks during the exam? Or when we open it do we have to stay on it?  \n",
    "A: Confirming you CAN take breaks. Once open, you can walk away and come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: One thing I'm curious about is whether or not the material covered this quarter can be foundational to learning programming languages other than Python.  I'm basically asking if learning Python can make it easier to learn other programming languages.  \n",
    "A: Great question! It absolutely can. The hardest programming language to learn is your first. After that, many of the concepts carry over. The syntax/specifics differ, but for your first language you have to learn the concepts, logic, and syntax. For your next language, it's mainly syntax that has to be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: My question is if we need to respond to all daily surveys for extra credit or can I just do some on them and have partial extra credit?   \n",
    "A: Each one you complete gets you some credit. You do NOT need to do all. (So, if you forget some days, no big deal!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What's the most widely-used programming language in the world?  \n",
    "A: Depends how it's measured, but I'd argue that it's C/C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I understand that we couldn't be sure if the coding labs would return to in-person learning after week 2 but I would just like to ask how likely accommodation would be made because I'm currently not in San Diego and it's near impossible for me to return to San Diego as an international student with nowhere to stay. Thank you!  </br>\n",
    "A: Coding labs are likely to return to in-person once campus OK's it...but remember that attendance is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: If we are going to be going back to in person learning, will lectures held in person still be posted in the media gallery for students to either watch a missed lecture or rewatch a lecture?   \n",
    "A: Yup! \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What does it mean that the assignments are graded “programmatically”? Thank you.   \n",
    "A: We'll talk more about this on Friday...but they are \"autograded,\" meaning we use a computer to grade assignments, rather than manually grading by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am currently the third on the waiting list. I am wondering am I be able to have access to the datahub while I am on the waiting list.   \n",
    "A: Yup - anyone with access to Canvas will have access to datahub. This includes those on the waitlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: are exams on canvas?  \n",
    "A: No. They'll be on datahub. You'll be *super* familiar with datahub by the time the first exam rolls around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am just a bit confused on the coding labs, do we work on them during section or can we also work on them before?   \n",
    "A: Up to you! They're designed so if you go to coding lab, you can work on them, and submit. However, they will typically be released on Friday and due on Wednesdays, so you're allowed to work on them any time in there! \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is campuswire different from piazza?  \n",
    "A: It's different in that they are different platforms/companies. However, their purpose is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: During the lecture, the professor said that there are 300 students. How does/do the person/people go over these surveys???  \n",
    "A: I (Prof Ellis) read them all. I think learning more about my students, understanding student questions, and knowing where students were confused/uncertain is really important...so I set aside time for reading these surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Are the assignments going to be one problem we have to solve or multiple problems?  \n",
    "A: Multiple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: If you know if this program of data hub and jupiter notebooks is able to work on ipads? and if not if you have any suggestions?  \n",
    "A: Yup - students have completed this course on an ipad previously.\n"
