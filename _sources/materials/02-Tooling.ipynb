    "- I was on the zoom lecture so I was wondering if they will still be happening? Or if it's mainly in person/podcasted format now.  <br>**I had a technical issue. Hopefully it's fixed now and we will have a proper hybrid class**\n",
    "- I am curious about the final project. I wonder if I will be able to actually create something at the end of the class! I have a bunch of ideas and cool concepts that are possible but, I do not know if it is possible for me to complete. I look forward to discovering if I can make a cool app!_ <br>**More project info covered in this lecture. Also you can check out the new [course website](https://cogs18.github.io/intro.html)** \n",
    "- Are iClicker questions mandatory? <br>**No! They are there to give you a way to interact and keep awake**\n",
    "- The most confusing part of this lecture for me are asterisks. I am not really sure when to use them since you can use underscore instead. <br> **I'm sorry to break the news, but lots of times in programming there are multiple ways to do exactly the same thing. Like in markdown you can use \\_ or \\* as you prefer to make italics. Or like x=\"blah blah\" is the same as x='blah blah' in Python. You will see a lot of this :)** \n",
    "- How can we jump out of Datahub and have our own copy of the codes. <br> **You can download files from Datahub to your own computer! File tab -> click the tickbox on left side of the filename -> click Download button at top of files list**  \n",
    "- How does Anaconda fit into what we learned about Jupyter notebooks?  <br> **Anaconda is an all in one download of a bunch of tools (e.g. Python, Jupyter, various packages) that will pretty much replicate what Datahub has on your own computer**\n",
    "- Are coding labs meant to be completed during the scheduled lab time? Or is that time set for us to ask questions about lab? <br> **Yes to both! The TA will go through some things and then open it up for questions. In the meantime you can work on your own.**"
