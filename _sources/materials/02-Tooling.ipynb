    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can we do both the final project and the final exam to compute the highest possible grade?  \n",
    "A: Nope. Due to sheer number of students, you have to choose which you want to do. If you submit both, we'll use the lower grade. We'll discuss this later in the quarter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: While a computer isn't necessary (and a tablet is sufficient), would a laptop/computer make it easier?  \n",
    "A: Yes - when doing the project, it would be slightly easier to navigate between files on a laptop, but students have completed this course on a tablet successfully previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I'm confused about how to sign into campuswire with the class code.  \n",
    "A: I think the link I posted was the wrong one. Apologies - try again now! Definitely follow up, please, if it does not work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I do not know how to do link the Iclicker to the canvas website  \n",
    "A: https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/29538/external_tools/51 (Note that if you previously registered your iclicker on Canvas at UCSD, you do not need to do so again...unless you have a new iclicker.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do we have to download a separate program on our devices  to work Python code?  \n",
    "A: Nope - everything can be done in datahub, which does not have to be downloaded. However, during the first coding lab you will be encouraged to download Anaconda. This will allow you to have access to Python and Jupyter after the course...as you will not have access to datahub forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is the final project posted before the day of the final exam? If you start the final project are you allowed to switch to taking the final exam?  \n",
    "A: Yes and Yes. We'll start discussing the final project right after the second midterm. And, you will be allowed to switch at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is an effective way to study for this class/take notes?  \n",
    "A: I'd encourage you to take notes directly in each day's jupyter notebook. We'll discuss this in class today!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What will the final project be like? Around how long do people spend working on it?  \n",
    "A: We'll discuss details after the second midterm. On average, students spend 10 hours on it...but that is over the course of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When will coding labs and assignments be posted? Can we work on them ahead of time or will coding labs be posted Wednesday then due Wednesday 11:59PM?  \n",
    "A: Coding labs will be posted on Fridays before the Wednesday they're due. You're definitely free to work on them ahead of time! You will always have at least a week to work on each assignment. I will announce at the top of class when assignments have been posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When do you recommend students start on the first assignment and coding lab?  \n",
    "A: As soon as possible. Once the material is covered in class, I encourage you to try that section of the coding lab and assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What’s the name of the iClicker app?  \n",
    "A: REEF\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do we need any computer science background before this class?  \n",
    "A: Nope! While having prior knowledge will make this course easier for some, those without any will be just fine!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For the daily participation survey thing, are we graded on how many questions AND how many days we participate, or just how many days we participate?  \n",
    "A: Just how many days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: im wondering if you update this google form every week manually or by a python code   \n",
    "A: Fun question! While I use python/code to automate many tasks in this course, I update the form by hand each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Should students in the waitlist buy textbook?  \n",
    "A: There is no textbook to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am curious if the midterms and finals will be around the same difficultly as the assignments or if they will be more difficult.   \n",
    "A: They are less difficult than the assignments b/c your time is limited and they must be completed on your own without outside help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is attendance in labs mandatory for all 10 weeks?  \n",
    "A: Lab attendance is never mandatory. Coding labs must be submitted for all weeks assigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: would it be possible to have lecture slides posted the night before class or will it be posted moments (Or the morning of) before class?  \n",
    "A: I totally understand this question, and if I'm being honest, it will typically be morning of. But, I'll try for night before!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How can we sign up for the coding lab and where it is?  \n",
    "A: You're already registered for a section - check webreg for time and location!"
