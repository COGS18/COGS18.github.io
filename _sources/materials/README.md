# LectureNotes-COGS18
Lecture Notes for COGS 18

These Jupyter notebooks are used in lecture for our Introduction to Python course.

New notebooks will be released here each class day. You can follow along and play yourself as we go through them.

If you're up for it, learn to use git (so many good tutorials out there!) so you can manually update your local copy of these notes.

Or you can just [click on this link](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCOGS18%2FLectureNotes-COGS18&urlpath=tree%2FLectureNotes-COGS18%2F&branch=main) 
which will automatically update your datahub with the newest notebooks.
