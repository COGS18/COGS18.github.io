    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I'm still confused about `%whos`. From my understanding if you run it, it shows all the variables in your code? With the type and what it's assigned to as well?  \n",
    "A: That's right - it shows all the variables you've defined in that current namespace. Every time you open a notebook, you connect to a kernel. This kernel allows you to execute code. When you execute code, you store variables in your namespace. When you run `%whos` it tells you everything stored in your namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: why is it called snake_case? Also, is there more to code style? Or is what we learned in this lecture all there is to it?  \n",
    "A: snake_case b/c everythign is on the same level like the body of a snake. camelCase is another common case, where the upper case letters are the \"humps\" of the camel's back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How to change variable types; for example after importing a dataset.   \n",
    "A: Take a look at \"typecasting in python\" results when you google! (We'll get to this later in the course.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How are coding assignments graded? Is it based on correctness or accuracy of the code?  \n",
    "A: They are graded programmatically based on the `assert` statements in the assignment - both visible and hidden. Correctness/accuracy matter. This will make even more sense after we grade A1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When you run the namespace in the jupyter nb is it supposed to give you an output?  \n",
    "A: Only if you've already defined variables in your namespace (meaning, run some code to create some variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What are examples of mutable variables? Or are they anything other than the variables we discussed in lecture today?  \n",
    "A: We'll get there soon! But, lists and dictionaries are two common mutable types we'll soon get comfortable with!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: what happens when the values for different variables are identical?   \n",
    "A: We'll talk a bit about this soon, but the answer is \"it depends.\" Sometimes python stores them in different places in memory; sometimes in the same. For this course, the details won't matter a ton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am curious if restarting the kernel means our memory is cleared and then reallocated for the variables in our code?  \n",
    "A: Your namespace/memory is cleared. When you restart the kernel no variables have been created yet. Code will have to be re-executed to store the variables in memory again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What exactly is the purpose of None type? How would it be used?  \n",
    "A: The example I gave in class is think about the gradebook for this class right now. Y'all haven't had any assignments graded yet, so each value would be `None`. We wouldn't want to use zero...b/c then students would be concerned they got no credit on the assignment! `None` is a good placeholder when you want to demonstrate the idea/concept of \"nothing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: i am curious about why python does not need to specify variable type like other languages  \n",
    "A: This is b/c Python is \"dynamically typed.\" The variable type is inferred directly from the code/syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What are the different colorings for the different variables?  \n",
    "A: black = variable; green = function or number; purple = operator; bold and green = reserved word in Python; red = warning or error\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is it possible to modify the namespace within the python code without explicitly creating variables? For example, deleting specific variables or creating variables to track the changes in other variables.  \n",
    "A: Yup, `del` will remove a variable from the namespace. As for the last example, not totally sure what you mean...so not sure if it is or is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When you print a variable, this makes it so that the variable can be used later or makes it so that it appears if you were to type %whos for example, correct?   \n",
    "A: Nope - `print` simply displays the variable to your screen. To `print` something, it has to already exist/have been defined. So the `=` statement creates the variable. After this, it can be `print`ed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will we be solving complex math problems on tests or homework assignments?   \n",
    "A: Nope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When calculating with floats, is there a best practice to make sure floats produce answers with the accuracy you want it to produce (for example, making sure an operation produces 2.0 and not 2.00000...001)? I noticed something like this happened on the assignment for this week and want to try and reduce that happening if possible.  \n",
    "A: There are ways (like forcing a certain number of decimal places)...but they won't be super important for this class. For example, if I ask you to do some operation that should return 2.3 as an answer, I am going to accept that value with uncertainty around it as an answer...to avoid any float/rounding issues. So, not something you have to worry about for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is there a way to print more than one variable at once? I've been using print(variable) for each variable in order to test what I did was right and it gets a bit tedious.   \n",
    "A: Yup - you can separate the variables by a comma in your print statement, for example: `print(var_a, var_b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am confused that is there a difference between using single and double quotes in python?   \n",
    "A: No difference - pick one and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can you assert a string? What does it mean to do so? What are you asserting?  \n",
    "A: Yes. If you assert a string, it asserts that the string is anything *other than* an empty string, so if there's something in the string, the `assert` will pass silently. What's more comment is to `assert` that the value of the string is exactly equal to a string. We'll see this more in coming assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can we work on A1 or any assignments for that matter in increments? I.e., if I start A1, may I leave it for some time and then come back to it without penalty or anything getting lost?  \n",
    "A: Yes, you are encouraged to work incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I am kind of confused the grading of Coding lab and also assignments.  \n",
    "A: Coding labs are graded on concerted effort. We (staff) look through to see if it looks like you spent ~1h of time on the coding lab. It's ok if there are errors, for example; you can still get full credit. Assignments are autograded, so they are graded for correctness. You'll see an example of this process soon with A1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I forgot to fill out a daily participation survey for Friday's (1-7) lecture. How do I submit this?  \n",
    "A: You don't, but it's for EC, so it's not a big deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can you divide variables by both / and // ? because I tried both ways and they both work...  \n",
    "A: Yup, `/` gives you a float; `//` returns the integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why both int(4) and int('4') gives an output 4 but int('4.0') raises an error?  \n",
    "A: Ah the joys/nuances of python! `int('4.0')` is interpreted the same as trying to convert the string '4.4' to an integer...python just don't know how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: can you convert a string (if it stores a number with a quotation mark) to integer type?    \n",
    "A: Yes, you would \"typecast\" this using `str('6')` for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How does using the % and %who differ?  \n",
    "A: `%` returns the remainder after division; `%who` lists what's currently stored in your namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Will there be situations where you can use indents in code?  \n",
    "A: Yes! Loops, functions, conditionals - we're getting there!"
